## Detection and segmentation of brain tumour from MRI images

This is a repository containing all the jupyter notebooks and python codes I have worked on as part of my term paper project during my Masters in University of Calcutta.

For training I have used the BraTS 2020 dataset and Keras/Tensorflow 2.0 and experimented with various U-Net architecture for image segmentation with a baseline accuracy of approximately 70% on validation set.

This is a work in progress.
